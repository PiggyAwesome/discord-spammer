### Only proof of concept! Do not use! Made for education reasons!
##### Do not use this selfbot! It is against the Discord Terms of Service! I made and uploaded this spammer to show skids how easy it is to program in python. (Yes)
##### If you do use this selfbot, PiggyAwesome will not be held responsible if anything happens with your account or anything you used this selfbot for.
